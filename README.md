# TechAssessmentEML
Create a scene with 6 cubes and 1 circle with the same colours and arrangements as the above GIF. 

The cursor is a circle that changes to the colour of the cube it overlaps with. 

When the cursor is on multiple cubes, additively blend the colours together and apply that to the circle. 

The default colour of the circle is black. 

(Not shown in GIF) When the cursor has hovered over a cube or multiple cubes for 3 seconds, 
change the colour of those cubes and other cubes that have the same colour to a different colour (any colour).
